# Explore South Tyrol
Explore South Tyrol is an innovative app for Android which, using Augmented Reality, lets you discover new cool places to see in South Tyrol. 

## Why? 
We want to encourage tourists to explore the South Tyrol, since we really liked it: full of green areas, entertainment and places to see - without a good help, there's a high chance you forgot to visit *that* great place you saw on the net. 

We are srongly convinced that IT and nature need to work together, in perfect harmony: our project aims to integrate IT into our real, green, beautiful world. 

Furthermore, we are open source lovers: the tons of South Tyrols' open data we could use and contribute to attracted us.  

## What?
We thought that the best way to do it was to create an Augmented Reality app for Android that shows you some great places near your position. The app uses Open Data to calculate the point of interests position and displays them on your screen, marked with a green pin - if you click on it, you can see a short description of the place.

Have you seen a very interesting place? Just swipe on your screen! You'll throw a star on the ground, marking the place where you are. If enough users do it, a starred pin will appear on the ground.
